# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** <br>

I got my BSc and MSc degrees from [METU Electrical & Electronics Engineering](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/). My research interests during my MSc degree was computer vision and deep learning. More spesifically, I was interested in training of the deep learning based image classifiers in existence of label noise.

I am currently working as a computer vision engineer in [Rapsodo Inc](https://rapsodo.com/). I love working on both classical computer vision algorithms and deep learning based approaches. I also love working and improving myself in C++ during deployment.

If you have any question or want to learn about me, you can reach me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/botan-y%C4%B1ld%C4%B1r%C4%B1m-414878b1/).
